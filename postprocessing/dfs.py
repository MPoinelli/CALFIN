def longest_DFS(edges, visited, index):

		Description:
			Recursive algorithm to find the longest path from a specified node in an undirected weighted graph.
		Parameters:
			edges: (N, Kx) dictionary - list of edges and their respective end points/weights, per starting points.
			visited: (N) array like - list of nodes already visited in previous searches. Enforces path restriction of traversing each node once.
			index: integer - starting node index in edges.

def longest_undirected_weighted_path(graph):
	"""
		Description:
			Algorithm to find the longest path in an undirected weighted graph.
			Performs 2 depth-first searches optimizing for length, to retrieve lognest overall path. Runs in O(N) time.
		Parameters:
			graph: (M, K) array_like - Symmetric adjacency/distance matrix of M vectors in K dimensions.
		Return Values:
			weight: int - length of longest path
			path: (P) array_like - list of indices correspodning to the longest path in the graph.
